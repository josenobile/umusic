To use the class simply copy the class.winampstatus.php file into your favorite include place then connect to the class using this:
$somevar = new winamp_control("user","pass","server1","server2");
then get the status
$somvar->getstatus();
... rest of script ...
you must use:
$somvar->closefp();
at the end off all the files that you instanced the winampcontroler in, or winamp will crash after a few times of accessing winamp.
